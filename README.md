# Multitenancy Package

[![Total Downloads](https://img.shields.io/packagist/dt/romegadigital/multitenancy.svg?style=flat-square)](https://packagist.org/packages/romegadigital/multitenancy)

This package is meant to be a quick and easy way to add multitenancy to your Laravel application. It simply creates models and relationships for Tenants and models. The package identifies incoming traffic by subdomain, and finds a corresponding tenant in the Tenant table. If none are found or the user is not associated with a particular subdomain, the user is met with a 403 error.

The `admin` subdomain is reserved for the package. It is used to automatically remove all scopes from users with a `Super Administrator` role.

To scope a resource to the currently accessed subdomain, you simply need to add a [single trait](#tenant-assignment-for-models) to the model and add a [foreign key relationship](#console-commands) to the model's table. The package middleware will automatically apply the scopes for the relevant models.

Any resources saved while accessing a scoped subdomain will automatically be saved against the current tenant, based on subdomain.

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

``` bash
composer require romegadigital/multitenancy
```

In Laravel 5.5 the service provider will automatically get registered. In older versions of the framework you should add the service provider in the `config/app.php` file:

```php
'providers' => [
    // ...
    RomegaDigital\Multitenancy\MultitenancyServiceProvider::class,
];
```

You can publish the config file with:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="RomegaDigital\Multitenancy\MultitenancyServiceProvider" --tag="config"
```

You can automate most of the setup by running:

```bash
php artisan multitenancy:install
```

It will:
- `publish` and `migrate` required migrations
- add a `Super Administrator` role and `access admin` permission
- add an `admin` Tenant model

## Usage

First, add the `RomegaDigital\Multitenancy\Traits\HasTenants` and `Spatie\Permission\Traits\HasRoles` traits to your User model(s):

```php
use Spatie\Permission\Traits\HasRoles;
use RomegaDigital\Multitenancy\Traits\HasTenants;
use Illuminate\Foundation\Auth\User as Authenticatable;

class User extends Authenticatable
{
    use HasTenants, HasRoles;

    // ...
}
```

The package relies on Eloquent, so you may access the User's tenants with `User::tenants()->get()`.

Inversely, you may access the Tenant's users with `Tenant::users()->get()`.

Tenants require a name to identify the tenant and and a subdomain that is associated with that user. Example:

`tenant1.example.com`

`tenant2.example.com`

These values could be added to the database like so:

```php
Tenant::createMany([
    [
        'name'    => 'An Identifying Name',
        'domain'  => 'tenant1'
    ],
    [
        'name'    => 'A Second Customer',
        'domain'  => 'tenant2'
    ]
]);
```

You can then attach user models to the Tenant:

```php
$user = User::first();
Tenant::first()->users()->save($user);
```

### Middleware

#### Authenticated
This package comes with `TenantMiddleware` middleware which extends Laravel's `Illuminate\Auth\Middleware\Authenticate`. You can add it inside your `app/Http/Kernel.php` file.

```php
protected $routeMiddleware = [
    // ...
    'tenant.auth' => \RomegaDigital\Multitenancy\Middleware\TenantMiddleware::class,
];
```

Then you can bring multitenancy to your routes using middleware rules:

```php
Route::group(['middleware' => ['tenant.auth']], function () {
    // ...
});
```

#### Guest Tenant
This package comes with `GuestTenantMiddleware` middleware which applies the tenant scope to all models and can be used for allowing guest users to access Tenant related pages. You can add it inside your `app/Http/Kernel.php` file.

```php
protected $routeMiddleware = [
    // ...
    'tenant.guest' => \RomegaDigital\Multitenancy\Middleware\GuestTenantMiddleware::class,
];
```

Then you can bring multitenancy to your routes using middleware rules:

```php
Route::group(['middleware' => ['tenant.guest']], function () {
    // ...
});
```

### Tenant Assignment for Models

Models can automatically inherit scoping of the current tenant by adding a trait and migration to a model. This would allow users to access `tenant1.example.com` and return the data from `tenant1` only.

For example, say you wanted Tenants to manage their own `Product`. In your `Product` model, add the `BelongsToTenant` trait. Then run the [provided console command](#console-commands) to add the necessary relationship column to your existing `products` table.

```php
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;
use RomegaDigital\Multitenancy\Traits\BelongsToTenant;

class Product extends Model
{
    use BelongsToTenant;

    // ...
}
```

> **Hint** 
> If the user is assigned `Super Administrator` access, they will be able to access the `admin` subdomain and the tenant scope will not register. This allows you to manage the data across all instances without needing individual access to each Tenant's account.

### Get Current Tenant

You can get the current tenant model:

```php
app('multitenancy')->currentTenant();
```

### Providing Access to Admin Domain

In order to access the `admin.example.com` subdomain, a user will need the `access admin` permission. This package relies on [Spatie's Laravel Permission](https://github.com/spatie/laravel-permission) package and is automatically included as a dependency when installing this package. We also provide a `Super Administrator` role on migration that has the relevant permission already associated with it. Assign the `Super Administrator` role to an admin user to provide the access they need. See the [Laravel Permission](https://github.com/spatie/laravel-permission) documentation for more on adding users to the appropriate role and permission.

A subdomain for the admin portal will be created automatically during [installation](#installation), but you can manually add it like this:

```php
Tenant::create([
    'name'      => 'Admin Portal',
    'domain'    => 'admin'
]);
```

## Console Commands

Generate a migration to add tenancy to an existing model's table:

```bash
php artisan multitenancy:migration products
```

Assign a user `Super Administration` rights and the `admin` Tenant:

```bash
php artisan multitenancy:super-admin admin@example.com
```

## Managing with Nova

There is a separate [Nova Package](https://github.com/romegadigital/MultitenancyNovaTool) available that allows you to manage the resources utilized in this package in Nova.
